    Info: Version 7.0 Build 33 02/05/2007 SJ Full Version
    Info: Processing started: Tue May 23 11:14:09 2000
Info: Command: quartus_fit --read_settings_files=off --write_settings_files=off modelsim_test -c modelsim_test
Info: Selected device EPM240T100C5 for design "modelsim_test"
Info: Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Info: Device migration not selected. If you intend to use device migration later, you may need to change the pin assignments as they may be incompatible with other devices
    Info: Device EPM240T100I5 is compatible
    Info: Device EPM570T100C5 is compatible
    Info: Device EPM570T100I5 is compatible
Warning: No exact pin location assignment(s) for 3 pins of 3 total pins
    Info: Pin div not assigned to an exact location on the device
    Info: Pin clk not assigned to an exact location on the device
    Info: Pin rst_n not assigned to an exact location on the device
Info: Fitter is using the Classic Timing Analyzer
Info: Timing requirements not specified -- optimizing circuit to achieve the following default global requirements
    Info: Assuming a global fmax requirement of 1000 MHz
    Info: Assuming a global tsu requirement of 2.0 ns
    Info: Assuming a global tco requirement of 1.0 ns
    Info: Assuming a global tpd requirement of 1.0 ns
Info: Completed User Assigned Global Signals Promotion Operation
Info: Completed Auto Global Promotion Operation
Info: Starting register packing
Info: Fitter is using Normal packing mode for logic elements with Auto setting for Auto Packed Registers logic option
Info: Started processing fast register assignments
Info: Finished processing fast register assignments
Info: Finished register packing: elapsed time is 00:00:00
Info: Statistics of I/O pins that need to be placed that use the same VCCIO and VREF, before I/O pin placement
    Info: Number of I/O pins in group: 3 (unused VREF, 3.30 VCCIO, 2 input, 1 output, 0 bidirectional)
        Info: I/O standards used: 3.3-V LVTTL.
Info: I/O bank details before I/O pin placement
    Info: Statistics of I/O banks
        Info: I/O bank number 1 does not use VREF pins and has unused VCCIO pins. 0 total pin(s) used --  38 pins available
        Info: I/O bank number 2 does not use VREF pins and has unused VCCIO pins. 0 total pin(s) used --  42 pins available
Info: Fitter placement preparation operations beginning
Info: Fitter placement preparation operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:00
Info: Fitter placement operations beginning
Info: Fitter placement was successful
Info: Fitter placement operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:00
Info: Estimated most critical path is register to pin delay of 2.913 ns
    Info: 1: + IC(0.000 ns) + CELL(0.000 ns) = 0.000 ns; Loc. = LAB_X2_Y4; Fanout = 2; REG Node = 'div~reg0'
    Info: 2: + IC(0.591 ns) + CELL(2.322 ns) = 2.913 ns; Loc. = PIN_4; Fanout = 0; PIN Node = 'div'
    Info: Total cell delay = 2.322 ns ( 79.71 % )
    Info: Total interconnect delay = 0.591 ns ( 20.29 % )
Info: Fitter routing operations beginning
Info: Average interconnect usage is 0% of the available device resources. Peak interconnect usage is 0%
    Info: The peak interconnect region extends from location X0_Y0 to location X8_Y5
Info: Fitter routing operations ending: elapsed time is 00:00:00
Info: The Fitter performed an Auto Fit compilation.  Optimizations were skipped to reduce compilation time.
    Info: Optimizations that may affect the design's routability were skipped
    Info: Optimizations that may affect the design's timing were skipped
Warning: The Reserve All Unused Pins setting has not been specified, and will default to 'As output driving ground'.
Info: Quartus II Fitter was successful. 0 errors, 2 warnings
    Info: Allocated 149 megabytes of memory during processing
